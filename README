HTML::WikiConverter::PbWiki version 0.01
========================================

HTML::WikiConverter::PbWiki adds the PbWiki dialect to HTML::WikiConverter, allowing the conversion of HTML to PbWiki markup, which you can post on pbwiki.com.

========
SYNOPSIS
========

Converting HTML to wiki markup is easy:

  use HTML::WikiConverter;
  my $wc = new HTML::WikiConverter( dialect => 'PbWiki' );
  print $wc->html2wiki( $html );

Or from the command line:

  % html2wiki --dialect PbWiki --base-uri=http://yoursite.pbwiki.com/ index.html > output.wiki
